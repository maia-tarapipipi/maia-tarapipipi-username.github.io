  <h4>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h4>
    <p>
      Imagine that creating a website is like building a magical mansion. The mansion has different rooms, windows, and doors, each with a unique purpose and style.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS are the barebones of the mansion. HTML is like the foundation and structure of the mansion, determining the placement of the rooms, doors, and windows. CSS is like the interior design, deining the colors, fonts, and styles of the walls, doors, and windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, HTML and CSS create a functional but fairly basic mansion. JavaScript, on the other hand is like the magic that brings the mansion to life. It adds interactivity, animation, and dynamic content to the mansion, making it more engaging and user-friendly.

  <h4>An analogy of control flow and loops using examples from everday life</h4>
    <p>
      Control flow refers to the order in which instructions or statements of a program are executed. This includes conditionals and loops. Loops are used to perform repetitive tasks, like iterating over a collection of data (like arrays) or performing a set of instructions a defined number of time.
      Imagine you've been given the task to cut carrots. You get the knife, cut off the top and bottom and then cut into chunks. These actions combined are what could be refered to as the control flow, a specific set of instructions in a defined way. The repetitive action of cutting the carrot is the loop, the same necessary but repetitive action.

  <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>
    <p>
      Using the analogy of the magic mansion, the DOM is like the spell to make the Javascript work. you call the document. then you stack on what you want to select
    </p>
  <h4>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
    <p>
      An array is data stored in a single line of code, which each piece of data being stored in order with an index position 0 - end of the array.
      eg. arrayname ['data1', 'data2', 3]
    </p>
    <p>
      An object stores data as sets of pairs called key-value pairs. You can access the data using the key nameeg. object.name
    </p>

  <h4>What are functions and why are they helpful</h4>
    <p>
      functions are useful pieces of code that performs a task or set of tasks. They can be refered to multiple times and help organize code into manageable pieces. Some examples of what funnctions can be helpful with is debugging, and being able to reuse and recall them later in the code.
