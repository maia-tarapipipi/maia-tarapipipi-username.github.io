<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h6>
  <p>My long term goal is to work remotely, to have more flexibility and balance between work and home.</p>
<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What are your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to learning?</h6>
  <p class="name">Stengths:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistence and perseverance</li>
    <li>Working consistently</li>
    <li>I can empathize with other's journey with mental health because of my own struggles</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="name">Weaknesses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I am aware I struggle with anxiety and I think this will be a major barrier in asking for help and presenting work.</li>
    <li>I go too fast and miss important information, which sometimes means I make mistakes and/or set myself back</li>
  </ul>
<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h6>
  <p>
    I would like to develop the growth mindset presented at the start of this course. I feel it takes the pressure off knowing and understanding immediately, and I think this will be key helping battle my own anxiety.
  </p>
<h6>Final Statements</h6>
  <p>
    It's important to me that consistency will be key in continuing this course and avoiding being overwhelmed. I will achieve this by regular routine work during the week (8am-4pm) with scheduled breaks during the day and rest during the weekends. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I have several tools such as meditation, art making, exercise and spending time with friends and family which I use to help manage my anxiety. I will also keep my facilitator informed if I find myself falling behind in course work or am feeling overwhelmed and need support. I understand that studying can be stressful and we're all going through it together, and I hope to help my peers though it as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm aware that I struggle to ask for help. I battle this by giving myself strict deadlines of asking for help. If I dont understand something I will give myself a timebox to try and understand it in, and if I dont have the answer by the end of the timebox I will ask for help or move on with the understanding that I will understand in the future.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help mitigate feeling overwhelmed because I've missed or skipped over important information I keep visual reminders to remain calm, read the course content carefully and take breaks when I feel like I'm moving too quickly.
  </p>
  <p>I expect the facilitation team to be kind, unbiased and open minded. I haven't encountered anyone that isn't though.</p>
  <p>
    I have no other prior commitments during the week or for the next couple months. My partner understands that I've commited to studying this course and is willing to support me so I can best make use of my time.

  <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

  <h3>Sunday, 30th April 2023</h3>

<div class="blog"></div>
<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h6>
  <p>
    My long term goal hasn't changed since week 2, I would say that by the end of bootcamp I would like to have a clearer direction of what I'd like my career path to be
  </p>
<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h6>
  <p>
    My strengths and weaknesses are still virtually the same but I'd say I'm also going to struggle with group and pair work during bootcamp. Times in the past when I've been required to work I've struggled with communicating with team members, managing expectations, finding effective compromises and being able to work with each individuals strength and weakness. These will be might biggest non-technical challenges in bootcamp.
  </p>
<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h6>
  <p>
    I would still like to continue working on growth mindset but I'd also like to work on mt weaknesses from the previous question such as communicating with team members, managing expectations, finding effective compromises and being able to work with each individuals strength and weakness.
  </p>
<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h6>
  <p>
    As before I expect the facilitation team to be kind, unbiased and open minded.
  </p>
<h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h6>
  <p>
    I expect myself to be kind, unbiased and open minded. I expect to ask for help in a timely way, as before, by setting a time-frame for when I'm stuck on a particular aspect. I also expect myself care for my body and mind, use my breaks to rest and recuperate.
