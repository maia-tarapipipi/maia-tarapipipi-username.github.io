  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h6>
      <p>My long term goal is to work remotely, to have more flexibility and balance between work and home.</p>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What are your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to learning?</h6>
    <p class="name">Stengths:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Persistence and perseverance</li>
          <li>Working consistently</li>
          <li>I can empathize with other's journey with mental health because of my own struggles</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="name">Weaknesses:</p>
        <p>I am aware I struggle with anxiety and I think this will be a major barrier in asking for help and presenting work.</p>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h6>
        <p>I would like to develop the growth mindset presented at the start of this course. I feel it takes the pressure off knowing and understanding immediately, and I think this will be key helping battle my own anxiety.</p>
  <h6>Final Statements</h6>
    <p>It's important to me that consistency will be key in continuing this course and avoiding being overwhelmed. I will achieve this by regular routine work during the week (8am-4pm) with scheduled breaks during the day and rest during the weekends. 
    </p>
    <p>I have several tools such as meditation, art making, exercise and spending time with friends and family which I use to help manage my anxiety. I will also keep my facilitator informed if I find myself falling behind in course work or am feeling overwhelmed and need support. I understand that studying can be stressful and we're all going through it together, and I hope to help my peers though it as well. </p>
    <p>I'm aware that I struggle to ask for help. I battle this by giving myself strict deadlines of asking for help. If I dont understand something I will give myself a timebox to try and understand it in, and if I dont have the answer by the end of the timebox I will ask for help or move on with the understanding that I will understand in the future.</p>
    <p>I expect the facilitation team to be kind, unbiased and open minded. I haven't encountered anyone that isn't though.</p>
    <p>I have no other prior commitments during the week or for the next couple months. My partner understands that I've commited to studying this course and is willing to support me so I can best make use of my time.</p>
