  <h4>Tell a story about a time you:</h4>
    <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>were blocked on a simple problem:</h6>
    <p>
      what was the problem?
      I got really blocked at the end of the restructuring a string problem in the Javascript kata. My code looked like it should work as I expected but every time I ran it through the test it wouldn't work. I tried a lot of different solutions, including reading more about the method (.filter) I was using, and how it worked, restructuring my code out to show each step, finally I used the test code in MND docs to put in parts of my code and figured out the problem was a relatively simple space between .join method and .split method. I got pretty frustrated whilst solving the problem, but I tried to stay calm, took breaks and did more research on each step. I learnt how to refine my problem solving by using the MDN windows and the importance of small sections on how the final output works.

  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>elegantly solved a problem.</h6>
    <p>
      what was the problem?
      I'm pretty satisfied with my solution from the above problem, it was challenging but I feel like it best encapsulates how my problem solving worked. 

    </p>

  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Pseudocode</li>
      <li>Trying something</li>
      <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
      <li>Reading error messages</li>
      <li>Console.logging</li>
      <li>Googling</li>
      <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
      <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
      <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
    <ul>
    <p>
       I would say I'm already okay with improving my process with reflection because it's a skill I've work with separately through my art practice. However, across the board I still need more practice with all these techniques. After this sprint I'm generally more confident with Googling, reading error messages and just trying something, for me these skills were indispensable to this particular sprint. I think the things that I need much more practice with are console.logging, asking for help and writing clear and defined pseudocode as a starting point. 
    </p>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h6>
  <p>
    I'm generally hesitant to ask for help when I'm struggling. This particular sprint, I found a lot of my classmates had already asked some of the questions I didn't understand so it didn't feel as urgent to ask questions directly however generally it's because I really struggle with putting myself out there.
