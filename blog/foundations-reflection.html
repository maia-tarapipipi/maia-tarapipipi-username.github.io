  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h6>
    <ul>
     <li>That my ego really got in the way of asking for help because I want to be perceived as smart, but all that does is in the way of my learning</li>
     <li>That I can be disciplined and hardworking if I put my mind to it, which includes working but also being kind to myself</li> 
     <li>I'm more capable than my anxiety gives me credit for</li>
    </ul>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h6>
    <p>
      During the learning process, you're bound to encounter others or yourself who will perhaps struggle or succeed. The ability to understand your own actions, empathize with another's and respect not only your own but others values is key creating a working environment that works for yourself and others.
    </p>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h6>
    <p>
      The idea that in learning, praise for outcome is not as important as praise for the behavior. As lovely as it is to be recognized for a beautiful product or grade, it isn't as conducive to learning and to moving forward. 
    </p>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h6>
    <p>
      Implementing meditation. I'm still struggling with including meditation regularly and journalling even though I'm already aware it'll be beneficial
    </p>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h6>
    <p>
      One reason is programming is a constantly evolving discipline, because of this after the course we'll continue learning the rest of our careers. Learning is inherently challenging, and sometimes can bring up negative emotions, some of the tools you're providing us with are tools to manage those feelings.
      Another reason is programming is a team sport. Core is designed to help students become better communicators and team members, a skill that when we apply for jobs they will be looking for.
    </p>
  <h6><span class="question">Question: </span>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h6>
    <p>
      Core doesn't feel like a waste of time to me, the skills we learn are foundational skills, just like the foundational skills we learn for programming. I came here because I wanted to be able to confidently apply for jobs with a new set of skills, and I trust that people who designed this course know what skills they are. If the skills I learn are not only programming but also better communication, development of self-awareness and empathy then I trust that those skills will help me apply for new work.
