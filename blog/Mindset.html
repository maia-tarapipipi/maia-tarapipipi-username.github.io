        <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
          <h6>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h6>
              <p>A growth mindset is a way of thinking and approaching challenges that emphasizes the abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard work, dedication, and perseverance. Growth mindset views failures and setbacks as learning opportunities and growth, rather than limitations or shortcomings.</p>
              <p>Growth mindset is relevant here because it requires a constant willingness to learn and adapt. Being open minded about change and learning is key to adpating to new challenges and techniques. Having a growth mindset is more more like to approach challenges with a positive attitude, viewing them as opportunities for growth and development and more like to persist in the face of difficult problems, seeking out solutions and new strategies to overcome obstacles.</p>
          <h6>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h6>
              <p>Learning about the concept of growth mindset has helped me to re-frame my approach to learning. It was surprising to learn that my ability and intelligence isn't fixed. Before starting this course, I thought my abilities were fixed and that receiving compliments about my work was the only way to confirm that I was learning and capable. However, understanding the principles of growth mindset has helped me to adopt a more positive attitude towards struggling and failing.</p>
              <p>Even just learning about it, I'm more willing to view challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth and improvement, rather than as evidence of my limitations. Now when I encounter difficulties, I am more curious about why I am struggling and open to asking for help. I am more willing to take risks and try new approaches, knowing that learning is a process that requires effort and perseverance.</p>
          <h6>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>Understanding diffuculty is part of learning and moving with difficulty</li>
                <li>Understanding that this is where my learning starts and in the future I'll continue learning and growing in this field</li>
                <li>Growth includes failure and difficulty</li>
              </ul>
