  <div class="section">
    <h4><span class="question">Question:</span> Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h4>
    <p class="name">The Decision:</p>
      <p>I try not to shop from fast fashion retailors when possible and shop mostly used/second hand clothing if I want new items. </p>
      <p class="name">The Reasoning:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Fast fashion from certain countries doesnt pay their staff correct wages or are in unsafe working conditions and labour practices.</li>
          <li>consuming less is better for the environment as it cuts down on emissions and waste</li>
          <li>supporting local industries and clothing brands promotes builds wider trade within Aotearoa</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There was evidence to support this from various news sites, the internet and because I previously worked in the fashion textile industry as a production assistant I was aware of the logisitics involved. </p>
      <p class="name">Reflections:</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I know my position is one of privilage, I can afford to choose not to consume fast fashion because my body or finances dont prohibit me from making that choice. I know that not all people have that luxury. I'm also aware that I don't have much of an impact environmentally and socially as a single person, however, my conscience feels less guilty if I can at least do something. 
      </p>
    
    <h4><span class="question">Question:</span> Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h4>
    <p>I'm Maori and I was raised in a part-pakeha part-Maori world. It would be fair to say that the predominant culture I grew up in was a Pakeha one, one that I didn't entirely belong to but one I had to assimilate into to feel accepted. As an adult, my goal is to feel more connected to my Maori culture but my journey in this has only really just started. I would say this has influenced my world view because it shapes my compassion to others who also feel othered by New Zealand culture. It connects me to people who also struggle with the feeling of being an outsider. It has also influenced my idea of justice, the health care system and social equity.</p>

    <h4><span class="question">Question:</span> Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    </h4>
    <p>According to the VIA Character Strengths profile my top 3 strengths are 1. Love, 2. Love of Learning and 3. Curiosity. </p>
     <p>I hope that love will translate into compassion for myself when I'm struggling, and helping others if I'm able to and hopefully supported by a love of learning and curiosity will keep propelling me forward.</p>
    
 
    <h4><span class="question">Question:</span> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
    <p>One of my limitations is my anxiety, which is supported by the Big 5 test scores. This translates to into strugging to ask for help. While studying for my degree I really struggled turning my research into practice and I struggled asking for help from tutors and technicians. I know this will affect my journey because it's a pivitol part of thinking like a developer but unlike my previous studies, I'm well aware of this trait of mine and I'm working with tools to manage my anxiety.</p>

    <h4><span class="question">Question:</span> Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h4>
    <p>Previously I had worked for a year under a manager that was a essentially a bully. Initially, I used compassion to understand how this person became this way and approach the situation calmly and rationally however over time her beheviour made it almost untenable to work as her subbordinant. I escalated her behaviour to higher managers and some changes were put in place but unfortuntely her behaviour didn't change. My final solution was reporting her behaviour to HR, with the idea that I would also resign (given she had more influence in the industry and this business and I didnt want to be present for the potential fall out). Fortunately, she was given the option of dismissal or resignation and she chose resignation. I stood up to her and her behaviour which I'm pretty proud of and I would say my solution to this problem was as good as I could do given the situation. 
      If I were to encouonter this again I think I would avoid waiting so long to approach HR and begin documentation of harrasment earlier because I didnt deserve to be treated that way for so long. </p>
